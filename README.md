# ⭐️ Shooting Stars ⭐️

### Specifications

This game was build using Java 21 and Gradle 8.10. This project uses Gradle features to be removed in Gradle 9, so Gradle cannot be upgraded.

## Goal of the game

The goal of the game is to shoot as many stars from the sky as posible, in a given time limit. Each successfuly shot star will earn you 10 points. Try to achieve the highest score possible, before the time runs out. For every miss (click outside the circle) 10 points will be subtracted from your score. However the your score can't go negative.☺️

## How to set up

Download the universal `jar` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/kireiiiiiiii/shooting-stars/releases/latest). Ensure you have Java 21 or higher installed on your system, and run the `jar` file you downloaded.

### Controls

-   **S Key**:               Starts the game in the main menu,
-   **Left Mouse Click**:    Shoots down the star target.
-   **R Key**:               Restarts the game.
-   **ESC Key:**:            Pauses the game.

## Future goals/tasks

-   Better target position generation (no overlaying with the score board, or on the edge of the frame)
-   Random target rotation
-   Better target hitbox (include the tips of the star, not just the center)
-   Sound effects and music
-   Add an exit button to the main screen
